# Search Selection

## Description

Search Selection will search for the selected text on any website you choose. Sites are easily added in the options for the extension.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to a permanent location
2. Open the extensions page in Chrome
3. Flip on developer mode in the upper right corner
4. Click the "load unpacked" button on the top left
5. Choose the folder that contains the extension files

## Usage

To add sites, you simply need to open the extension options and click add site. When entering the site url, you must enter the url and the search parameter. For example, for Youtube you would enter https://youtube.com/search?q=.

Each site will be different. If you look at the URL of a site after you do a search, the word or key you want to put between the ? and the = will be the one that has the search terms after the = sign. A lot of sites have it right after the ? like Youtube does, but some have other parameters first. In the case of those sites, you will be looking for the term after an &. For example, ebay has a search URL like this https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=toast&_sacat=0. For ebay, you will want the _nkw. The completed url in the settings will be https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=
